Since the dataset you're using only has a vocabulary of 227 English words of the thousands that you use, you're only going to see good results using these words.  For this project, you don't need a perfect translation. However, if you want to create a better translation model, you'll need better data.\n",

However, this will take you days to train, so make sure you've a GPU and the neural network is performing well on dataset we provided.  Just make sure you play with the WMT10 corpus after you've submitted this project.\n",
